# Use Claude Code to Explore and Develop the project 
### Download the zip file of branch 'initial'
https://github.com/uopsdod/claude_code_treasure_game/tree/initial

### initialize the context
/clear
/init: generate the CLAUDE.md to understand how this project works 

npm install
npm run dev'

### specify file to the current context 
> use @src/audios/chest_open.mp3 in the @src/App.tsx to play the sound effect of the chest being opened. do not do anything else.

### add more to the context
> check the comments of existing changes

type '#' first 
"Always add comments on the top of every new function in one line to summarize the usage and Must document the inputs and output parameters" 
> 2. Project memory

> use @src/audios/chest_open_with_evil_laugh.mp3 in the @src/App.tsx to play the sound effect of the chest with skeleton inside being opened  

> check the comments of existing changes

### use screenshot to develop intuitively 
> screenshot and mark the area you want the change to be. 
> [!image] show the results to be either: win, tie, loss in the circled place according to the final score 

### Challenge: change the hover mouse point icon
use the src/assets/key.png icon when the mouse hovers over the closed treasure box

### manage context
